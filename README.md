# LifeComputeShader
Game of life running in a compute shader in Unity

Shader was made following tutorial found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItPTBSeGjdM&t=611s)

If you want to use it yourself just add the C# and compute files to your project and add the C# file to an object with a material.
You'll need to provide a starting 2d texture in the input field, it's dimensions should match your selected width and height (attributes defined in the inspector). I've provided a 2D texture here that's 512x512, feel free to use it.
